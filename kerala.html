    Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about <br>
    1 percent of the total area of the country. Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km)<br>
     along the Malabar Coast, varying in width from roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km).<br>
      It is bordered by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu <br>
      to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, a segment <br>
    of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).<br></font>
