    <h1>Bibi ka Makbara</h1>
    <p>Built in 1668 the Tomb of Rabia Durani or Bibi Ka Maqbara was erected by Azam Shah, <br>the son of Aurangzeb to commemorate his mother Dilras Begum who was titled Rabia Durani post her death.<br> Being the spitting image of the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum is also called the Taj of the Deccan or the Dakkhani Taj. <br>The north of the country is dotted with the specimens of the Mughal architectural magnificence,<br> Bibi Ka Maqbara stands as a lone soul in the southern part. It was Aurangzeb’s<br> long-standing governorship of Aurangabad that the shrine came to exist in the city and is today one of the most famous historical monuments in Maharashtra. <br>

   <h1> Bibi Ka Maqbara History</h1>
   The story of Dilras Banu is nothing short of a fairytale. Born in the Safavid royal family<br> of Iran, princess Dilras was the daughter of Shahnawaz Khan who was the then viceroy of the state of Gujarat.<br> She married Aurangzeb in 1637 thus becoming his first consort and wife. Together they had five children and after delivering her fifth child,<br> Dilras died. Both Aurangzeb and his eldest son, Azam Shah couldn’t bear the loss of the most important woman in their lives. It is said that the father-son duo were grief stricken for <br>months and it took great efforts for them to come out of the state of shock. It was then in 1668 that Azam Shah ordered for a mausoleum to be built <br>for his beloved mother on the lines of Taj Mahal, which was the resting place of Banu’s<br> mother-in-law and Aurangzeb’s mother, Mumtaz Mahal. Both the women died because of complications developed through childbirth. <br>
