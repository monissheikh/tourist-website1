   <font size="6">Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is located in the heart of the Kashmir valley at<br> 
   an altitude of 1,730 m above sea level. Spread on both sides of the river Jhelum the city is <br>famous for its natural beauty,
    gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. Srinagar is called <br>the city of lakes and the Venice of the East, fascinating tourists
     from centuries with <br>its beautiful picturesque Himalayan backdrop, glittering lakes that are surrounded by houseboats and
      Shikaras and the <br>majesty of Mughal architecture. The very absence of order in the location of the houses and their tumbled 
      down <br>appearance add a peculiar charm to the scenery. It has its own quaint lifestyle, telling a panoramic fairytale<br>
       tour through the snow-capped mountains and Chinar trees, while enjoying the adventurous <br>pleasures of hiking, mountain 
       biking, and rafting. The city is also famous for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and <br>dried fruits.</font>
